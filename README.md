# Dissertation_code

This code was used to produce species distribution model predictions under four scenarios. The first represents natural estuarine conditions, whilst the following three scenarios address the consequences of implmenting operationalised lagoon scenarios within the River Severn. This is seen under the heading "prediction_maps".
From this statistical analysis was undertaken in the form of a Wilcoxon to test statistical significance between medians of species distribution change. This is found within "Wilcoxon_test"
Following this a one-way ANOVA was undertaken to establish where significance was occuring within the dataset, located within "ANOVA".
Species area calculations were also undertaken to quantify the differences in species distribution chnage seen by operationalising tidal lagoon scenarios. This section produces histograms and violin plots to determine distribution changes - "Area_chnage_stats".
The code provided facillitates the analysis of the distributon of the species T. amplivasatus. This was then replicated for all species being studied within the report.
